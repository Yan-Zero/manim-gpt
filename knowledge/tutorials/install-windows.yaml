  content: "The easiest way of installing Manim and its dependencies is by using a package manager like Chocolatey or Scoop. If you are not afraid of editing your System’s PATH, a manual installation is also possible. In fact, if you already have an existing Python installation (3.8 or above), it might be the easiest way to get everything up and running.\n\nIf you choose to use one of the package managers, please follow their installation instructions (for Chocolatey, for Scoop) to make one of them available on your system."

- name: "Manual Installation-install-windows"
  content: "As mentioned above, Manim needs a reasonably recent version of Python 3 (3.8 or above) and FFmpeg.\n\nPython: Head over to https://www.python.org, download an installer for a recent version of Python, and follow its instructions to get Python installed on your system.\n\nNote: We have received reports of problems caused by using the version of Python that can be installed from the Windows Store. At this point, we recommend staying away from the Windows Store version. Instead, install Python directly from the official website.\n\nFFmpeg: In order to install FFmpeg, you can get a pre-compiled and ready-to-use version from one of the resources linked at https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows, such as the version available here (recommended), or if you know exactly what you are doing you can alternatively get the source code from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and compile it yourself.\n\nAfter downloading the pre-compiled archive, unzip it and, if you like, move the extracted directory to some more permanent place (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\). Next, edit the PATH environment variable: first, visit Control Panel > System > System settings > Environment Variables, then add the full path to the bin directory inside of the (moved) ffmpeg directory to the PATH variable. Finally, save your changes and exit.\n\nIf you now open a new command line prompt (or PowerShell) and run ffmpeg, the command should be recognized.\n\nAt this point, you have all the required dependencies and can now install Manim via\n\npython -m pip install manim"

- name: "Optional Dependencies-install-windows"
  content: "In order to make use of Manim’s interface to LaTeX to, for example, render equations, LaTeX has to be installed as well. Note that this is an optional dependency: if you don’t intend to use LaTeX, you don’t have to install it.\n\nFor Windows, the recommended LaTeX distribution is MiKTeX. You can install it by using the installer from the linked MiKTeX site, or by using the package manager of your choice (Chocolatey: choco install miktex.install, Scoop: scoop install latex, Winget: winget install MiKTeX.MiKTeX).\n\nIf you are concerned about disk space, there are some alternative, smaller distributions of LaTeX.\n\nUsing Chocolatey: If you used Chocolatey to install manim or are already a chocolatey user, then you can simply run choco install manim-latex. It is a dedicated package for Manim based on TinyTeX which contains all the required packages that Manim interacts with.\n\nManual Installation: You can also use TinyTeX (Chocolatey: choco install tinytex, Scoop: first scoop bucket add r-bucket https://github.com/cderv/r-bucket.git, then scoop install tinytex) alternative installation instructions can be found at their website. Keep in mind that you will have to manage the LaTeX packages installed on your system yourself via tlmgr. Therefore we only recommend this option if you know what you are doing.\n\nThe full list of LaTeX packages which Manim interacts with in some way (a subset might be sufficient for your particular application) are:\n\namsmath babel-english cbfonts-fd cm-super ctex doublestroke dvisvgm everysel fontspec frcursive fundus-calligra gnu-freefont jknapltx latex-bin mathastext microtype ms physics preview ragged2e relsize rsfs setspace standalone tipa wasy wasysym xcolor xetex xkeyval"

  content: "Required Dependencies\nThere are several package managers that work with conda packages, namely conda, mamba and pixi.\n\nAfter installing your package manager, you can create a new environment and install manim inside by running\n\n# using conda or mamba\nconda create -n my-manim-environment\nconda activate my-manim-environment\nconda install -c conda-forge manim\n# using pixi\npixi init\npixi add manim\n\nSince all dependencies (except LaTeX) are handled by conda, you don’t need to worry about needing to install additional dependencies."

- name: "Linux-install"
  content: "The installation instructions depend on your particular operating system and package manager. If you happen to know exactly what you are doing, you can also simply ensure that your system has:\n\n- a reasonably recent version of Python 3 (3.8 or above),\n- with working Cairo bindings in the form of pycairo,\n- FFmpeg accessible from the command line as ffmpeg,\n- and Pango headers.\n\nThen, installing Manim is just a matter of running:\n\npip3 install manim\n\nNote: In light of the current efforts of migrating to rendering via OpenGL, this list might be incomplete. Please let us know if you ran into missing dependencies while installing.\n\nIn any case, we have also compiled instructions for several common combinations of operating systems and package managers below."
