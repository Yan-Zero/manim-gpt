  content: "Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately. Manim relies on Python’s simplicity to generate animations programmatically, making it convenient to specify exactly how each one should run. Take a look at the Example Gallery for some inspiration on how to create beautiful images and videos with Manim."

- name: "Navigating the Documentation-index"
  content: "Here are some short summaries for all of the sections in this documentation: The Example Gallery is a collection of examples (rendered videos and images together with the code they were generated from) that show a few different, simple things that you can do with Manim. The Installation section has information on installing Manim. In Tutorials & Guides you can find learning resources: proper tutorials that guide you through the process of creating a video are in the Tutorial section; guides on specific topics are in the Guides section, and the answers to frequently asked questions can be found in the FAQ section. The Reference Manual contains a comprehensive list of all of Manim’s (documented) modules, classes, and functions. If you are somewhat familiar with Manim’s module structure, feel free to browse the manual directly. If you are searching for something specific, feel free to use the documentation’s search feature in the sidebar. Many classes and methods come with their own illustrated examples too! The Plugins page documents how to install, write, and distribute plugins (that is, separate Python packages that extend the feature set of the core library). Changes between versions are documented in our Changelog. If you are looking into contributing to the development of Manim, you can find information on how to get involved in our Contributing section. And finally, the Code of Conduct page has a formal description of the rules you should abide by when interacting within our community."

- name: "macOS-install-mac"
  content: "For the sake of simplicity, the following instructions assume that you have the popular package manager Homebrew installed. While you can certainly also install all dependencies without it, using Homebrew makes the process much easier.\n\nIf you want to use Homebrew but do not have it installed yet, please follow Homebrew’s installation instructions.\n\nNote: For a while after Apple released its new ARM-based processors (the Apple Silicon chips like the “M1 chip”), the recommended way of installing Manim relied on Rosetta, Apple’s compatibility layer between Intel and ARM architectures. This is no longer necessary, Manim can (and is recommended to) be installed natively."
  description: "Introduction to installing Manim on macOS, recommending the use of Homebrew."

- name: "Required Dependencies-install-mac"
  content: "To install all required dependencies for installing Manim (namely: ffmpeg, Python, and some required Python packages), run:\n\nbrew install py3cairo ffmpeg\n\nOn Apple Silicon based machines (i.e., devices with the M1 chip or similar; if you are unsure which processor you have check by opening the Apple menu, select About This Mac and check the entry next to Chip), some additional dependencies are required, namely:\n\nbrew install pango pkg-config scipy\n\nAfter all required dependencies are installed, simply run:\n\npip3 install manim\n\nNote: A frequent source for installation problems is if pip3 does not point to the correct Python installation on your system. To check this, run pip3 -V: for macOS Intel, the path should start with /usr/local, and for Apple Silicon with /opt/homebrew. If this is not the case, you either forgot to modify your shell profile (.zprofile) during the installation of Homebrew, or did not reload your shell (e.g., by opening a new terminal) after doing so. It is also possible that some other software (like Pycharm) changed the PATH variable – to fix this, make sure that the Homebrew-related lines in your .zprofile are at the very end of the file."

- name: "Optional Dependencies-install-mac"
  content: "In order to make use of Manim’s interface to LaTeX for, e.g., rendering equations, LaTeX has to be installed as well. Note that this is an optional dependency: if you don’t intend to use LaTeX, you don’t have to install it.\n\nFor macOS, the recommended LaTeX distribution is MacTeX. You can install it by following the instructions from the link, or alternatively also via Homebrew by running:\n\nbrew install --cask mactex-no-gui\n\nWarning: MacTeX is a full LaTeX distribution and will require more than 4GB of disk space. If this is an issue for you, consider installing a smaller distribution like BasicTeX.\n\nShould you choose to work with some partial TeX distribution, the full list of LaTeX packages which Manim interacts with in some way (a subset might be sufficient for your particular application) is:\n\namsmath babel-english cbfonts-fd cm-super ctex doublestroke dvisvgm everysel fontspec frcursive fundus-calligra gnu-freefont jknapltx latex-bin mathastext microtype ms physics preview ragged2e relsize rsfs setspace standalone tipa wasy wasysym xcolor xetex xkeyval"
