  content: "Depending on your use case, different installation options are recommended: if you just want to play around with Manim for a bit, interactive in-browser notebooks are a really simple way of exploring the library as they require no local installation. Head over to https://try.manim.community to give our interactive tutorial a try. Otherwise, if you intend to use Manim to work on an animation project, we recommend installing the library locally (either to a conda environment, your system’s Python, or via Docker). Note that there are several different versions of Manim. The instructions on this website are only for the community edition. Find out more about the differences between Manim versions if you are unsure which version you should install."

  content: "Conda is a package manager for Python that allows creating environments where all your dependencies are stored. It is a good way to install Manim since all dependencies like ffmpeg, pycairo, etc. come with it. Also, the installation steps are the same, no matter if you are on Windows, Linux, Intel Macs, or on Apple Silicon. There are various popular alternatives to Conda like mamba/micromamba, or pixi. They all can be used to set up a suitable, isolated environment for your Manim projects."

- name: "Installing Manim locally-install"
  content: "Manim is a Python library, and it can be installed via pip or conda. However, some additional system dependencies need to be installed first. Manim requires Python version 3.8 or above to run. The following pages have operating system-specific instructions for you to follow. Depending on your setup, the installation process might be slightly different. If you encounter issues, join our Discord or start a new Discussion on GitHub."
