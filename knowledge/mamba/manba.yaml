  content: "Mamba Installation\n\nFresh install (recommended)\nWe recommend that you start with the Miniforge distribution >= Miniforge3-22.3.1-0. If you need an older version of Mamba, please use the Mambaforge distribution. Miniforge comes with the popular conda-forge channel preconfigured, but you can modify the configuration to use any channel you like.\n\nAfter successful installation, you can use the mamba commands as described in mamba user guide.\n\nNote\n\nAfter installation, please make sure that you do not have the Anaconda default channels configured.\n\nDo not install anything into the base environment as this might break your installation. See here for details."
